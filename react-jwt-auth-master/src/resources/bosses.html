            <h4>FLY-BY</h4>
            <p>
              Dvalin disappears from view, then swoops through the center of the
              platform, dealing a massive amount of damage
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>WHAT TO DO</h4>
            <p>
              Move to the edge of platform, or time your dodge when his claws
              hit the bridge
            </p>

            <h4>DRAGON BREATH</h4>
            <p>
              Dvalin lands on the player's side of the platform and unleashes a
              powerful breath between his feets
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>WHAT TO DO</h4>
            <p>
              After Dvalin lands, dash towards the other side of the platform.
              Deal as much damage as possible to his talons to whittle away his
              shield.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h4>BITE</h4>
            <p>
              Dvalin bites towards the area the player are standing on. It is a
              quick attack that deals moderate damage.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>WHAT TO DO</h4>
            <p>
              stand at the center front of the platform, the rear of the
              platform, or stay on the wind current. It is possible to deal
              damage to both the talons and his head after he attacks, but there
              is a small window
            </p>

            <h4>PULSE BOMB</h4>
            <p>
              Dvalin shoots two pairs of Pulse Bomb towards you, exploding upon
              impact.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>WHAT TO DO</h4>
            <p>
              The attack is aimed but not homing, so it can be dodged by
              continuously moving in one direction.

          <div>
            <h4>ENERGY RAIN</h4>
            <p>
              Dvalin unleashes a rain of Pulse Bombs to attack a group of
              platforms you are standing on. The affected platforms deal
              continuous damage to the character on the field. The longer the
              character stands on the platform, the higher the damage received.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>WHAT TO DO</h4>
            <p>Move to the nearest unaffected platform</p>
          </div>
        </div>

          <div>
            <h4>OMEGA BOMB</h4>
            <p>
              Dvalin fly to the other end of the arena and begin charging. He
              then unleashes a gigantic pulse bomb towards the platform. It
              deals massive damage to the entire platform.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>WHAT TO DO</h4>
            <p>
              Stay above the platform using the wind current to avoid damage.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h4>ENERGY LIGHTNING</h4>
            <p>
              Periodically, there will be circular indicators on the ground
              showing where the energy pulse will strike (actual radius is not
              accurately defined). These bolts deal low-moderate damage, but
              failing to dodge them will whittle away your HP.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>WHAT TO DO</h4>
            <p>DPS check. Dodge and hurry and finish off Dvalin.</p>
